# vsgExamples
Example programs that test and illustrate how to use the [VulkanSceneGraph/VkSceneGraph](https://github.com/robertosfield/VulkanSceneGraphPrototype/) and optional add-on libraries. The example programs are grouped according to their dependencies:

## examples_vsg
Contains [examples](examples_vsg/) that depend upon the core **vsg** library provided by the [VulkanSceneGraphPrototype](https://github.com/robertosfield/VulkanSceneGraphPrototype/) and [Vulkan](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).

## examples_osg2vsg
Contains [examples](examples_osg2vsg/) that depend upon the core **vsg** library, **Vulkan**, and add the dependency on [osg2vsg](https://github.com/robertosfield/osg2vsg/) library which in turn depends upon [OpenSceneGraph](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph/). The examples_osg2vsg are only built when osg2vsg is available.
