# ----------

# Try to find OSG2VSG
#
# IMPORTED Targets
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED` target ``OSG2VSG::OSG2VSG``, if
# OSG2VSG has been found.
#
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# This module defines the following variables::
#
#   OSG2VSG_FOUND           - True if OSG2VSG was found
#   OSG2VSG_INCLUDE_DIRS    - include directories for OSG2VSG and third-party OSG2VSG-Hpp
#   OSG2VSG_LIBRARIES       - link against this library to use OSG2VSG
#
# The module will also define the following cache variables::
#
#   OSG2VSG_INCLUDE_DIR     - the OSG2VSG include directory
#   OSG2VSG_LIBRARY         - the path to the OSG2VSG library
#
