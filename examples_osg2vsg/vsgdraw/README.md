## vsgdraw - port of VulkanTutorial
The vsgdraw example was developed during the ExplorationPhase as a test bed of the VSG Vulkan integration. 

The [VulkanTutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) was used as a guide for what Vulkan calls are required to create a window, set up state and geometry data and render to depth buffered window.  Feature wise the vsgdraw matches up to Depth Buffer stage of the tutorial, but is very different in C++ style and usage virtual of use of the VSG's Vulkan integration streamlining the Vulkan setup.
